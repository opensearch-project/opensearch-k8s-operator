# Opensearch Operator New version release guide

This guide will explain the new version release process in Opensearch-k8s-Operator

## Logic

Under the relases process we can find two main actions
* ####Operator release
  Responsible to build and publish new Opensearch-k8s-operator images, builds from the 'release.yaml' workflow that triggers from new tag creation with 'v' prefix.
* ####Helm release
  Respoinsable for Helm chart repo update, will set helm chart version to version from tag and will Run action to build chart and publish it to a new release and update the index in the `gh-pages` branch, will also publish version to Artifacthub. builds from the 'helm-release.yaml' workflow that triggers from new tag creation with 'helm' prefix.

###Steps
So for a release we need the following manual steps:
1. Create a new tag "vX.Y.Z"
2. Wait until pipeline is finished
3. Create a new tag "helm-X.Y.Z"
